Predicting what will be the sentiment of a reader on reading the news headlines of finance PyPI - Python Version

**Problem statement:**  For a given financial news headline, we need to predict what will reader feel. Is his/her response on reading a headline will be negative, positive or neutral. We will be using the FinancialPhraseBank Public Dataset by Ankur Sinha available on Kaggle. TThe dataset contains two columns, "Sentiment" and "News Headline". The sentiment can be negative, neutral or positive. In order to achieve this in a real-world scenario, we will be using ZenML to build a production-ready pipeline to predict the sentiment of a reader on reading the financial news headline.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how ZenML empowers your business to build and deploy machine learning pipelines in a multitude of ways:

* By offering you a framework and template to base your own work on. 
* By integrating with tools like MLflow for deployment, tracking and more 
* By allowing you to build and deploy your machine learning pipelines easily 


## üêç Python Requirements

Let's jump into the Python packages you need. Within the Python environment of your choice, run:

git clone https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects.git  
cd zenml-projects/SentimentAnalysis  
pip install -r requirements.txt

Starting with ZenML 0.20.0, ZenML comes bundled with a React-based dashboard. This dashboard allows you to observe your stacks, stack components and pipeline DAGs in a dashboard interface. To access this, you need to launch the ZenML Server and Dashboard locally, but first you must install the optional dependencies for the ZenML server:

pip install zenml["server"]  
zenml up

If you are running the run_deployment.py script, you will also need to install some integrations using ZenML:

zenml integration install mlflow -y

The project can only be executed with a ZenML stack that has an MLflow experiment tracker and model deployer as a component. Configuring a new stack with the two components are as follows:

zenml integration install mlflow -y  
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow  
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow  
zenml stack register mlflow_stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --set


# üëç The Solution
In order to build a real-world workflow for predicting the sentiment of the reader on reading a financial news headline , it is not enough to just train the model once.

Instead, we are building an end-to-end pipeline for continuously predicting and deploying the machine learning model, alongside a data application that utilizes the latest deployed model for the business to consume.

This pipeline can be deployed to the cloud, scale up according to our needs, and ensure that we track the parameters and data that flow through every pipeline that runs. It includes raw data input, features, results, the machine learning model and model parameters, and prediction outputs. ZenML helps us to build such a pipeline in a simple, yet powerful, way.

In this Project, we give special consideration to the MLflow integration of ZenML. In particular, we utilize MLflow tracking to track our metrics and parameters, and MLflow deployment to deploy our model. We also use Streamlit to showcase how this model will be used in a real-world setting.

Training Pipeline Our standard training pipeline consists of several steps:

* ingest_data: This step will ingest the data and create a DataFrame. 
* clean_data: This step will clean the data and remove the unwanted columns. 
* train_model: This step will train the model and save the model using MLflow autologging. 
* evaluation: This step will evaluate the model and save the metrics -- using MLflow autologging -- into the artifact store.

**Deployment Pipeline**  
We have another pipeline, the deployment_pipeline.py, that extends the training pipeline, and implements a continuous deployment workflow. It ingests and processes input data, trains a model and then (re)deploys the prediction server that serves the model if it meets our evaluation criteria. The criteria that we have chosen is a configurable threshold on the MSE of the training. The first four steps of the pipeline are the same as above, but we have added the following additional ones:

* deployment_trigger: The step checks whether the newly trained model meets the criteria set for deployment. 
* model_deployer: This step deploys the model as a service using MLflow (if deployment criteria is met). 

In the deployment pipeline, ZenML's MLflow tracking integration is used for logging the hyperparameter values and the trained model itself and the model evaluation metrics -- as MLflow experiment tracking artifacts -- into the local MLflow backend. This pipeline also launches a local MLflow deployment server to serve the latest MLflow model if its accuracy is above a configured threshold.

The MLflow deployment server runs locally as a daemon process that will continue to run in the background after the example execution is complete. When a new pipeline is run which produces a model that passes the accuracy threshold validation, the pipeline automatically updates the currently running MLflow deployment server to serve the new model instead of the old one.

To round it off, we deploy a Streamlit application that consumes the latest model service asynchronously from the pipeline logic. This can be done easily with ZenML within the Streamlit code:

service = prediction_service_loader( pipeline_name="continuous_deployment_pipeline", pipeline_step_name="mlflow_model_deployer_step", running=False, ) ... service.predict(...) # Predict on incoming data from the application 

While this ZenML Project trains and deploys a model locally, other ZenML integrations such as the Seldon deployer can also be used in a similar manner to deploy the model in a more production setting (such as on a Kubernetes cluster). We use MLflow here for the convenience of its local deployment.


# üìì Diving into the code
You can run two pipelines as follows:

* Training pipeline:
python run_pipeline.py
* The continuous deployment pipeline:
python run_deployment.py



# üïπ Demo Streamlit App
If you want to run this Streamlit app in your local system, you can run the following command:-
streamlit run app.py



# ‚ùì FAQ

#### 1. When running the continuous deployment pipeline, I get an error stating: No Step found for the name mlflow_deployer.

It happens because your artifact store is overridden after running the continuous deployment pipeline. So, you need to delete the artifact store and rerun the pipeline. You can get the location of the artifact store by running the following command:

zenml artifact-store describe

and then you can delete the artifact store with the following command:

Note: This is a dangerous / destructive command! Please enter your path carefully, otherwise it may delete other folders from your computer.

rm -rf PATH


####  2. When running the continuous deployment pipeline, I get the following error: No Environment component with name mlflow is currently registered.

You forgot to install the MLflow integration in your ZenML environment. So, you need to install the MLflow integration by running the following command:

zenml integration install mlflow -y
